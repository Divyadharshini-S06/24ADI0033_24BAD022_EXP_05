This scenario focuses on predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant using medical measurement features. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is implemented to perform classification. The dataset is first inspected and preprocessed to ensure data quality. Target labels are encoded into numerical form for model compatibility. Feature scaling is applied since KNN is distance-based and sensitive to feature magnitudes. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. The KNN classifier is trained with different values of K to analyze model sensitivity. Predictions are generated on the test set and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Misclassified cases are identified for further analysis. Visualizations such as the confusion matrix, accuracy vs K plot, and decision boundary help interpret model performance.

Loan Prediction Dataset

This scenario aims to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected using applicant and loan-related features. A Decision Tree classifier is used for classification. The dataset undergoes preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Relevant input features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, education, and property area are selected. The data is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation. The Decision Tree model is trained with different depths to study pruning effects. Predictions are made on unseen test data. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature importance is analyzed to understand key decision factors. Overfitting behavior is examined by comparing shallow and deep trees. Visualizations including the confusion matrix, tree structure plot, and feature importance plot support model interpretation.
